HelpDifferential=Differential = Timestamped subdirectory under destination directory for each run. Files are hardlinked from the subdirectory of the previous backup (if there is one) and then the differences are synchronized from the source directory.
HelpFull=Full = Timestamped subdirectory under destination directory for each run. Files are always fully copied from the source directory.
HelpIncremental=Incremental = Single destination directory. New and modified files in the source directory are copied to the destination directory. Files deleted from the source directory are kept (not deleted) in the destination directory.
HelpRetention=Retention is set as number of timestamped subdirectories. When the limit is reached, the oldest directory will be deleted. With retention set to 1, differential and full methods don't create timestamped directories and only synchronize the contents of the source directory to the destination directory.
